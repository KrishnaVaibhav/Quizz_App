### <a name="_toc173960848"></a>**1. AWS Lambda vs. Amazon EC2**
- **AWS Lambda** [1] automatically manages the compute fleet, offering a serverless architecture that scales on demand without requiring manual intervention. This is particularly beneficial for applications with variable and unpredictable workloads, like a quiz platform, where traffic can spike unpredictably due to new quizzes being released or popular quizzes drawing sudden interest.
- **Amazon EC2** [10], while flexible and powerful, requires setting up and managing virtual servers, including scaling, patching, and securing these servers. This adds a layer of complexity and administrative overhead that Lambda eliminates, making Lambda a more efficient choice for developers looking to focus more on application logic than infrastructure management.

<a name="_toc173960849"></a>**2. Amazon DynamoDB vs. Amazon RDS**

- **Amazon DynamoDB** [2] is a NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. For a quiz application, which typically requires rapid reads and writes of relatively simple data structures (such as user scores and quiz metadata), DynamoDB's model is optimal. It offers built-in high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Amazon RDS** [11] is better suited for applications that require complex transactions with relational data, benefiting from SQL queries' capabilities. However, the overhead of managing relational database features (like schema updates and complex joins) may not be necessary for a quiz application, making DynamoDB a more streamlined and efficient choice.

<a name="_toc173960850"></a>**3. AWS API Gateway vs. Elastic Load Balancing**

- **AWS API Gateway** [3] provides a set of tools specifically designed for API management, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access controls, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. This makes it highly suitable for applications that are heavily reliant on APIs, as it simplifies both the deployment and the operational management of these APIs.
- **Elastic Load Balancing** [12] can distribute incoming network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones, which increases the fault tolerance of applications. However, it lacks the API-specific features provided by API Gateway, making the latter more appropriate for handling the backend communications in a quiz application.

<a name="_toc173960851"></a>**4. AWS Cognito vs. Amazon IAM**

- **AWS Cognito** [5] offers comprehensive capabilities for handling user identities in web and mobile applications, including user registration, authentication, and user-specific data synchronization across devices. This makes it particularly useful for applications needing a robust, scalable solution for user management without additional backend infrastructure.
- **Amazon IAM** [13] manages access to AWS services and resources securely, but it is not designed to manage end-user authentication within applications. Cognito's focus on application-level security and identity management makes it the better option for controlling user access within the quiz platform.

<a name="_toc173960852"></a>**5. Amazon SNS vs. Amazon SES**

- **Amazon SNS** [4] allows messages to be sent to a large number of subscribers, including mobile devices, email addresses, and even HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, through a simple, highly scalable, and robust messaging infrastructure. This versatility is crucial for applications that may need to expand notification capabilities beyond email in the future.
- **Amazon SES** [14] is optimized for sending email and handling incoming email but lacks the broader messaging capabilities provided by SNS, such as sending SMS or mobile push notifications, which could limit communication flexibility in dynamic application scenarios.

<a name="_toc173960853"></a>**6. Amazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront vs. Amazon EBS**

- **Amazon S3** [6] combined with **Amazon CloudFront** [7] creates a powerful solution for storing and delivering static content globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. S3 provides durable infrastructure to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, while CloudFront distributes it efficiently worldwide.
- **Amazon EBS** [15] provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances but is not designed for direct static content hosting. For applications that require rapid, global access to static resources (like JavaScript files, images, and CSS for a quiz application), the combination of S3 and CloudFront is far more effective.

<a name="_toc173960854"></a>**7. AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline vs. Jenkins**

- **AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline** [8] provides a seamless integration with other AWS services, which simplifies the continuous integration and continuous deployment process. These services automate the code from build to production, ensuring a smooth deployment pipeline within the AWS ecosystem.
- **Jenkins** [16], while highly customizable and widely used, requires significant setup and maintenance of servers. If your stack is primarily AWS, utilizing AWS's native tools can reduce complexity and increase efficiency due to better integration and managed service offerings.

<a name="_toc173960855"></a>**8. AWS CloudWatch vs. Datadog**

- **AWS CloudWatch** [9] offers monitoring services that are tightly integrated with AWS, providing insights into application and infrastructure performance with metrics, logs, and events. This deep integration makes it ideal for monitoring AWS resources effectively without the need for additional configuration.
- **Datadog** [17] is a powerful monitoring tool that works across cloud services and offers extensive metrics and integrations. However, for AWS-specific resources, CloudWatch's native integration and capabilities provide streamlined monitoring solutions without the interoperability challenges that can arise with third-party tools.

The diagram illustrates the flow of data and interactions between different AWS services and the application components.
## <a name="_toc173960858"></a>**Architecture Overview**
My quiz application employs a serverless architecture, which means that the management, scaling, and patching of servers are handled by AWS, allowing you to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management. This approach is particularly effective in handling variable workloads, such as those experienced by a dynamic quiz platform where user traffic can fluctuate dramatically.

Additionally, the application is structured around microservices, where each service performs a specific function. This modular architecture enhances the scalability and flexibility of the application, making it easier to update and scale parts of the application independently without affecting the entire system.
